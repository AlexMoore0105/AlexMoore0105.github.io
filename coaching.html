      <p>Overwatch 2 is a 5v5 first person shooter game that includes several different heroes, game modes, and unique maps. Teams can consist of groups of friends or random players, and the map is dependent on the game mode’s objective. The main goal of the game is to cooperate with each other to complete the objective and beat the other team. Overwatch 2 is rated T for Teen and has a 1.8⭐ rating. It is rated T because it contains violence, smoking, and blood. </p>
      <p>For players that are new to the game and want an effective and relatively easy character to play, Moira is a good choice. With simple abilities, Moira is very learner friendly. Moira is often referred to as a "DPS support" because she is able to heal in long bursts, as well as dealing a lot of damage over time. In order to charge her biotic grasp (primary fire), or healing, Moira needs to deal damage to her opponents by using her biotic grasp (alt fire). On PC, the type of grasp can be changed by using the different mouse buttons. The left mouse is used to heal and the right mouse is used to damage. </p>
