<p style="color:#9462FF"><b>Blog:</b> Video games are so enticing and entertaining because they engage multiple parts of the brain and allow for expression of creativity. Video games also allow players to interact with others who share similar interests and can enhance communication skills. Storylines in games also entice players by providing them an immersive experience and with characters with which they can become attached to.</p> 

<article style="color:#9462FF"><b>Article:</b> Sam Von Ehren, the Game Maker for The New York Times, explains why games are so universally loved. Ehren stated that games, whether video games, card games, board games etc., are considered fun because they are a “controlled form of freedom.” Playing a game is an “act of exposition” that allows players to make a series of choices, shaping how they think.</article>

<p style="color:#9462FF"><b>Article:</b> The overall review is very positive, and I have to agree. Stardew Valley is a wonderful multifaceted game that allows for freedom of creativity and fun. There are numerous paths that can be taken in the game, such as farming, mining, fighting, romancing, and oftentimes a mix of all. It’s a great way to pass the time and it can be played either solo or with friends! It’s genuinely such a beautiful and enjoyable game. </p>

<p style="color:#9462FF"><b>Blog:</b> The MSI Stealth GS77 would make a good computer for me because it’s portable, has high graphics, and runs smoothly. I prefer laptops since I move my setup a lot, so the portability is a great aspect of this computer. Seeing as I mostly want a good computer to game on, the fast performance and high graphics would allow for optimal gaming.

<p style="color:#9462FF"><b>Blog:</b> Competitive gaming, much like competitive sports, can come with negative emotions. Toxicity in gaming has become increasingly common over the years as gaming develops to support more online features. Toxic behavior may consist of sexual harassment, hate speech, violent threats, doxxing, and sabotaging one’s own team. Gaming companies are working to combat in-game toxicity by developing player reporting systems and monitored voice chat, but it isn’t always enough. The best way to combat toxicity in gaming is to speak up when it’s happening.
